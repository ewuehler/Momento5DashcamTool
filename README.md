# Momento 5 Dashcam Video Parser

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
The Momento 5 Dashcam video is embedded in a standard video container, AVI.  This parses out the video into the associated bits.

### In the interim...
If you have `ffmpeg` installed and are using either Linux or Mac, you can use [convert2mp4.sh](convert2mp4.sh) to take a single file and export a video (with the picture-in-picture) for front and rear cameras.  Depending if you record with the rear camera reversed or not, it may need a little tweaking.  I found this much more efficient that trying to load the videos from the custom app that you can download.
